WebregSync
==========

bookmarklet to scrape the webreg HTML, should pop out a file that you save in a test editor as a ".ical" suffix. Export that file to Google Calendar and there you go.
This is the first working version. More or less a beta for the summer session. It also doesn't have locations working yet. Getting there. Thanks, feel free to fork and give suggestions.
